## What's Next Level Week?
NLW is a practical week with a lot of code, challenges, networking and a single goal: to take you to the next level. With this method you will learn new tools, new technologies and discover hacks that will boost your career. A totally free online event that will help you take the next step in your evolution as a developer. Offered by RocketSeat.
